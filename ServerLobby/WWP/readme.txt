This is the very latest ServerList.htm for WWP (as of 9/9/2014) that contains the contemporary server list, including Team17's UK server, StepS' W:A/WWP cross-server, noam's new test server, and a link for you to test your newly created server. The default one on port 80 is for normal usage. WWP supports arbitrary IRC ports, so you can just start a second MyWormNET server with any other IRC port and HTTP port 81, so that it doesn't interfere with your main setup (of course it's advised to be done in a different directory).
Have fun!
